# JSX Exercise

## Space Phenomena Tracker ðŸŒ 

Hello, future software developer! In this exercise, we will practice JSX in React through a space phenomena tracker system.

Your mission is to track various space phenomena, categorizing them based on their observation status (`Visible`, `Faint`, `Prime for Study`), which is determined randomly ðŸŽ². You will also employ conditional rendering to highlight phenomena that are `Prime for Study`, encouraging explorers to bring their advanced equipment.

## Tasks ðŸ“‹

- Render each space phenomenon with its emoji and name alongside the observation status, which you will randomly determine.
- For each phenomenon with `Prime for Study` observation status, excite the explorers with a message using conditional rendering, emphasizing to bring their advanced equipment.

Happy coding!

## Starter Code ðŸŒ±

- `index.html` serves as the entry point for the web application which is completed for you.
- `App.js` is the main component. To complete the tasks above, you are given a list of phenomena and their observation statuses.
